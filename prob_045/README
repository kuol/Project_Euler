The easiest way to think about this problem is reframe the question as:
Find n, such as T_n = P_n = H_n (:=y).

We can solve 3 quadratic equations for n respectively, expressed in y.
We have:
n_T =(-1+sqrt(1+8y))/2 ~ sqrt(2y)
n_p =(1+sqrt(1+24y)/6  ~ sqrt(2y/3)
n_H =(1+sqrt(1+8y))/4  ~ sqrt(1/(2y))

thus, in order to have T_n = P_n = H_n, with n sufficiently large, we have
roughly: 
n_T: n_p : n_H = 2: 2/sqrt(3):1

Notice that 285:165:143 roughly satisfy this relation


Now we can use this to make our algorithms O(n)
