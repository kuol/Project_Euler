The answer is: 2*3*5*7*11*13*17 = 510510

I'm not giving a rigorous proof here, but heuritics that a rigorous proof can base on.
Imagine the prime numbers are your bomb and number 1,2,..., 1000000 are your targets.
You mission is to "bomb off" as many targets as possible.

e.g. Bomb 2: can bomb off half of the targets (even numbers)
	 Bomb 3: bomb off about 1/3 - 1/2*1/3 = 1/6
     ...

Heristic 1:
===========
Apparently the smaller the prime number is, the more powerful it makes the bomb.

Heuristic 2:
============
Also notice that, Bomb 4 = 2^2 is as powerful as 2. 
In fact Bomb 2^d (d>1) is as powerful as 2.
Since the "fighter jet" can only carry bombs to certain "weight" 
(bomb1 * bomb2 *...* bombn < 1,000,000 ) we don't want to waste, but want to 
carry as diverse bombs as possible. 

After several 1, 2 trials, we get the answer easily.
