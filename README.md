Project Euler
=============

These exercises are mainly written in python. I'm learning Scala and will put
more scala code. The directory of excercises that are coded in scala have "_sc"
surffix

The order of code I've finished:

  * _07/08/2014_: *Problem 22* (2): easy  
  * _07/09/2014_: *Problem 45* (3): easy, if you know the math  
  * _07/09/2014_: *Problem 15* (4): easy-medium, depends on if you know dynamic programming, 
                                    pure recursive too slow!
  * _07/12/2014_: *Problem 36* (5): medium, I think my algorithm is OK, since I only need to 
                                    test 1110 numbers, but I have problem to come up with a 
                                    more general code that deal with number beyond 1 million.
                                    Maybe recursive algorithm is the way to go...
  * _07/12/2014_: *Problem 31* (4): medium, Coin change problem
  * _07/15/2014_: *Problem 54* (4): Algorithm is easy, coding,testing is harder. Used unittest module to help
  * _07/16/2014_: *Problem 59* (3) easy, if you make educated guess...
  * _07/17/2014_: *Problem 67* (4) Similar to Problem 15 -- think bottom up
  * _07/18/2014_: *Problem 69* (2) It's a problem that you only need a calculator to solve
  * _08/07/2014_: *Problem 102* (1): Really easy if you know basic definition of cross product
  * _09/06/2014_: *Problem 199, 78* (5): I've partially solved Problem 199 -- by looking for reference about Descartes' theorem. It still returns some warning info, which I don't have time to fix for now. For Problem 78 -- it demonstrates that math can be very powerful. Pure dynamic programming simply can't solve it. More work needs to be done
  * _09/17/2014_: *Problem 6* (1): First scala programming exercise!
  * _11/10/2014_: *Problem 68* 5-gon ring(3): the most difficult part for me is to wirte permutation P(n,k) -- forgot how to do it
  * _11/11/2014_: *Problem 85* counting rectangles (2): Pretty straight forward -- use (a+b)>= 2*sqrt(ab) !
  * _11/14/2014_: *Problem 86* shortest path on a centroid (4): Used Euclid formula to generate primitive Pythagorean triples.
