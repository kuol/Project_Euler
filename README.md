=============

The order of code I've finished:

  * _07/08/2014_: *Problem 22* (2): easy  
  * _07/09/2014_: *Problem 45* (3): easy, if you know the math  
  * _07/09/2014_: *Problem 15* (4): easy-medium, depends on if you know dynamic programming, 
                                    pure recursive too slow!
  * _07/12/2014_: *Problem 36* (5): medium, I think my algorithm is OK, since I only need to 
                                    test 1110 numbers, but I have problem to come up with a 
                                    more general code that deal with number beyond 1 million.
                                    Maybe recursive algorithm is the way to go...
  * _07/12/2014_: *Problem 31* (4): medium, Coin change problem
  * _07/15/2014_: *Problem 54* (4): Algorithm is easy, coding,testing is harder. Used unittest module to help
  * _07/16/2014_: *Problem 59* (3) easy, if you make educated guess...
  * _07/17/2014_: *Problem 67* (4) Similar to Problem 15 -- think bottom up
